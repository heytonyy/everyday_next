### Light Mode:

Card background: bg-gray-200
Primary title text: text-gray-900
Secondary title text: text-gray-700
Accent "dodger blue": text-blue-500

- Use lower contrast ratios than dark mode. Aim for at least 3:1 contrast between text and background colors.
- Avoid pure black text. gray-900 is a good alternative.
- Make sure interactive elements like links have distinguishable styles and underlines.
- The text-black class could be used for things like disclaimers to make them stand out.
- For secondary/disabled actions, use text-gray-500 instead of pure gray.

### Dark Mode Colors:

Card background: bg-gray-800
Primary title text: text-white
Secondary title text: text-gray-400
Accent "dodger blue": text-blue-400

- Using a color contrast checker like WebAIM to ensure text colors have sufficient contrast against the background colors. Aim for at least 4.5:1 contrast ratio.
- Avoid using pure black or pure white text. Go for off-blacks and off-whites like gray-900 and gray-100 instead.
- Make sure interactive elements like links are clearly distinguishable through more than just color. Use underlines or other indicators.
- Allow users to customize colors if possible. A dark mode toggle is great, but also consider a high contrast mode.
